                  ObservedGenerations contains information about the observed generations of a component.
                  This information is required to determine whether a component's controller has already processed some changes or not.
                properties:
                  internalConfiguration:
                    description: |-
                      InternalConfiguration contains the last generation of the InternalConfiguration belonging to the owning v1alpha1.ManagedControlPlane that has been seen by the controller.
                      Note that the component's controller does not read the InternalConfiguration itself, but fetches this information from a label which is populated by the v1alpha1.ManagedControlPlane controller.
                      This refers to metadata.generation of the InternalConfiguration belonging to the owning v1alpha1.ManagedControlPlane, if any.
                      If the resource does not have a label containing the generation of the corresponding InternalConfiguration, this means that no InternalConfiguration exists for
                      the owning v1alpha1.ManagedControlPlane. In that case, the value of this field is expected to be -1.

                      ManagedControlPlane contains the last generation of the owning v1alpha1.ManagedControlPlane that has been by the controller.
                      Note that the component's controller does not read the ManagedControlPlane resource itself, but fetches this information from a label which is populated by the v1alpha1.ManagedControlPlane controller.
                      This refers to metadata.generation of the owning v1alpha1.ManagedControlPlane resource.
                      This value is probably identical to the one in 'Resource', unless something else than the v1alpha1.ManagedControlPlane controller touched the spec of this resource.
